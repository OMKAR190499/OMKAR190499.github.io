    We intend to build a progressive web application that would be a solo place where students would be able to track the upcoming assignments, class tasks in an easy way . This tool allows students to even check for updates in the calendar about upcoming to-do lists, memo functionality. This tool will also provide the flexibility for the students to customize the look of the application based on their own choice of themes.The project was implement by Node.js with mongodb in the backend and React.js in the front-end.
